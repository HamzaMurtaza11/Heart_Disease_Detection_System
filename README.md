# Heart_Disease_Detection_System
The problem is to find out whether a person or patient has a heart disease or not. This artificial intelligent program ( machine learning ) can be a fantastic solution to figuring out whether a patient has a heart disease by using complex programming and statistical techniques. The AI machine learning system will be using a model or an estimator which will be trained on a dataset of clinical records of patients. The data set contains some sensitive features with values. The data will be prepared and clean, transform, and pass to machine learning model and get trained by training set and then will be tested by test set. An EDA ( Exploratory Data Analysis) is performed on the data to get deep insights about the data ( which includes descriptive data analytics and data visualization) to refine and improve the data to achieve a great accuracy percentage. The model score is then improved by tuning the applied model through hyper-parameter tuning. The evaluation metrics (accuracy, ROC/AUC, confusion matrix, f1 score, precision) are also measured. This problem is the type of binary classification problem because it has two categories ( YES OR NO ) . The classification models such as Random Forest, K-Neighbors and Logistic regression classification models are coded to compare which model gives the best result for heart diseases data training.
